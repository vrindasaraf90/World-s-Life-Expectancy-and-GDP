Per Capita GDP is a financial metric that breaks down a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a nation by its population.
The data For each of 142 countries, provides values for life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population, every five years, from 1952 to 2007.

<h2>Python Libraries Used:</h2> <br>
<b> Matplotlib:</b> <br>
This library is responsible for plotting numerical data. And that’s why it is used in data analysis. It is also an open-source library and plots high-defined figures like pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, graphs, etc. <br>
<br>
<b> Pandas: </b><br>
Pandas are an important library for data scientists. It is an open-source machine learning library that provides flexible high-level data structures and a variety of analysis tools. It eases data analysis, data manipulation, and cleaning of data. Pandas support operations like Sorting, Re-indexing, Iteration, Concatenation, Conversion of data, Visualizations, Aggregations, etc. <br>
<br>
<b> Numpy:</b> <br>
The name “Numpy” stands for “Numerical Python”. It is the commonly used library. It is a popular machine learning library that supports large matrices and multi-dimensional data. It consists of in-built mathematical functions for easy computations. Even libraries like TensorFlow use Numpy internally to perform several operations on tensors. Array Interface is one of the key features of this library. <br>
<br>
<b> Plotly: </b> <br>
The plotly Python library is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases. <br>
<br>
<b> Bubbly: </b> <br>
Bubbly is a package for plotting interactive and animated bubble charts using Plotly. The animated bubble charts can accommodate upto seven variables in total viz. X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis, time, bubbles, their size and their color in a compact and captivating way. Bubbly is easy to use with plenty of customization, especially suited for use in Jupyter notebooks and is designed to work with plotly’s offline mode such as in Kaggle kernels. <br>
